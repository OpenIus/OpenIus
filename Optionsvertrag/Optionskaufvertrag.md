PREAMBLE
## A.	The Company is organized in the form of a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) registered with the commercial register of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, under the number CHE-XXX.XXX.XXX, having its offices at Strasse 1, 1000 Seldwyla, Switzerland; 
## B.	The Optionee is an employee of the Company.
## C.	The Company wishes to grant the Optionee certain Options (as defined herein) entitling the Optionee to receive shares in the Company as per the conditions of this option agreement (the "Agreement"). The grant shall be made to the Optionee in his capacity as employee.

Based on the foregoing, the Parties to this Agreement agree as follows:
## 1.	Grant of Options
The Optionee is hereby granted 500,000 of options free of charge. Each option shall entitle the Optionee to subscribe for one (1) registered common share in the Company with a nominal value of CHF 0.01 each (each an "Option" and together the "Options"), subject to the terms of this Agreement. 
## 2.	Acknowledgement
The Optionee acknowledges and agrees that any grant hereunder (i) does not form part of any remuneration legally or contractually owed by the Company under any agreement, if any, (ii) does not confer any voting or pecuniary rights until granted Options have been exercised and the Optionee has become a shareholder in the Company according to the terms of this Agreement, and (iii) does not confer any right of continued contractual relationship, if any, between the Company and the Optionee.
## 3.	Exercise of Options
### 3.1	Exercise Price
The exercise price (the “Exercise Price”) per Option shall be at nominal value, i.e. CHF 0.01 per share, payable immediately upon exercise of the Option(s) according to section 3.2.

### 3.2	Exercise Period and Exercise Notice
The Options may be exercised, subject to earlier forfeiture of the Options as per this Agreement, as of the date hereof at any time until the ten-year anniversary of this Agreement (the “Exercise Period”) by way of filing of the exercise notice (the “Exercise Notice”) attached in Annex 3.2 with the Company. 

### 3.3	Acceleration
#### 3.3.1	Upon Change of Control
The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) may, at its full discretion, decide that all Options, whether vested or not and whether exercisable or not, shall fully and immediately vest and be exercisable within a certain period of time to be determined by the Board and communicated in a written notice to the Optionee within 30 days upon a Change of Control occurring.
Any Options not exercised by way of filing of the Exercise Notice within such period of time shall automatically be forfeited and the Company shall have no further obligation with respect to such Options. 
The term “Change of Control” shall be defined as:
a)	any person or any group of persons acting in concert directly or indirectly purchases or otherwise becomes the beneficial owner, or has the right to acquire such beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is exercisable immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to any condition), of voting securities representing more than 50% of the combined voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the Company; 
b)	the shareholders of the Company approve an agreement to merge or consolidate the Company with or into another corporation as a result of which less than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving or resulting entity are, or are to be owned by, the former shareholders of the Company;
c)	the sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the Company's business and/or assets to a person or entity that is not a wholly owned subsidiary, directly or indirectly, by the Company.
In a Change of Control, the Board may determine, at its sole discretion, that the Options are settled on a cashless basis in which case the Company shall settle the Options by paying the difference between the relevant purchase price per share applicable in the Change of Control transaction and the Exercise Price to the Optionee, less any applicable withholdings and deductions and taking into consideration any prior-ranking preferences of other shareholders.

#### 3.3.2	Upon IPO
In the event of an IPO, the Board shall notify the Optionee 30 days at least before the expected date of the IPO that an IPO is expected (the “IPO Notice”). The IPO Notice shall be notified by email and by registered letter.
During or prior to the IPO, all Options granted under this Agreement, exercisable or not, shall be immediately exercisable and shall be exercised within 10 days following the date of the IPO Notice by way of filing of the Exercise Notice. Any Option not exercised within these 10 days shall automatically be forfeited and the Company shall have no further obligation with respect to such Options.
The term “IPO” shall be defined as the going public of the Company with the listing of the shares of the Company on a recognized stock exchange.

### 3.4	Forfeiture of Options
Any Option granted to the Optionee terminates and shall forfeit without further notice and without any further obligation of the Company if any Exercise Period or, as the case may be, any notice period during which the Exercise Notice shall be received by the Company according to section 3.2 lapses.

### 3.5	Conditions Precedent to Exercise
The exercise of Options is subject to the fulfilment of the following conditions precedent:
a)	the Options have not forfeited at the date the Company receives the Exercise Notice;
b)	at the Board’s free discretion, it may decide that the Optionee shall accede and the Optionee shall then have acceded to the then current shareholders’ agreement in relation to the Company, it being understood and agreed that such shareholders’ agreement will contain, inter alia, transfer restrictions regarding the shares (including but not limited to rights of first refusals, purchase rights, drag-along and tag-along rights).

## 4.	Miscellaneous
### 4.1	Taxation, Duties
All taxes, charges and duties, including without limitation stamp duty and transfer taxes, income taxes and capital gain taxes, if any, connected to any grant of Options or any exercise thereof shall be borne by the Optionee, except for any stamp duties and other costs directly related to the issuance and delivery of shares, if any, payable by the Company shall be borne by the Company.

### 4.2	Discretionary Nature
Unless otherwise expressly agreed upon in writing, the granting of any Options or payments hereunder to the Optionee is on a voluntary basis, subject to the provision that even repeated grants of Options or payments without the reservation of voluntariness shall not create any legal claim for the Optionee, neither in respect to their cause nor their amount nor for the past nor for the future. 

### 4.3	Dilution Protection
In case of future changes in the capital structure of the Company, the Board may, in its absolute discretion, decide whether additional Options, if any, shall be granted to the Optionee.

### 4.4	Non-Transferability, Non-Assignability 
The Options are not transferable or assignable other than by inheritance law. The Optionee shall not pledge, hypothecate or otherwise create any lien on any Options.

### 4.5	Severability
If any part or provision of this Agreement be held to be invalid or unenforceable by any competent court, governmental or administrative authority having jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain valid. In this case, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a substitute provision that shall be reformed and construed so that it will be valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 4.6	Amendments
Any amendment of this Agreement, including this provision, shall only be valid if it is based on a written agreement signed by both Parties.

### 4.7	Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Agreement and all grants of Options shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of Switzerland, without regard to the conflict of law principles.
Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the ordinary courts at the domicile of the Company.
